# pngcheck-vulns

A repository of proof-of-concept files demonstrating disclosed and patched vulnerabilities in pngcheck (2.4.0 - 3.0.1).

Each POC is custom crafted with dedicated generation scripts to trigger specific bugs, covering both CVE-numbered and unnumbered vulnerabilities.

For detailed vulnerability analysis, see [my research notes](https://13m0n4de.vercel.app/sec/vulns/pngcheck/index.html).

## Summary

Note that some vulnerability types may differ from their CVE descriptions or official classifications. These are subjective categorizations.

## Usage

Each vulnerability folder contains:

- POC files (PNG/MNG format)
- Python script to generate POC

Some vulnerabilities may not show obvious symptoms when triggered. Recompiling with sanitizer options like `-fsanitize=address` can help better identify these issues.

For detailed instructions, refer to the README.md in each directory.
